# COVID-19 Ramp Up Comparison

This is a small program that visually illustrates the ramp up of the COVID-19 virus, comparing
multiple countries. The start date for each country is determined by using one of the following
criteria:

* An offical state of emergency is declared
* A major closure of an epicenter or major shelter-in-place type of order is issued
